# The "Day 1 Pro" GitHub Setup Guide

**For: Logic Analyst Role**

This guide will set up your GitHub environment so you look like a senior developer immediately. Follow these steps exactly.

## Phase 1: The Account (Looking the Part)

Your profile is your resume. If it’s empty, you look like a liability.

1. **Sign Up / Log In**: Go to [github.com](https://github.com).
2. **Profile Picture**: Do NOT use a selfie or an anime character. Use a clean headshot or a simple geometric abstract avatar.
3. **Bio Text**: Paste this exactly into your Bio:
    > "Logic Analyst & Systems Architect. Focus on algorithmic efficiency and workflow optimization. Student @ SUSS."
4. **Status**: Set your status (smiley face icon) to: 🎯 *Focusing on KABAS Logic*

## Phase 2: The Fork

You need your own copy of the code to work on safely.

1. Go to the **Team Repository URL** (The one your professor/lead gave you).
2. Look at the top-right corner. Click the button that says **Fork**.
3. **Important**: Uncheck "Copy the `main` branch only" if asked. You want everything.
4. Click **Create Fork**.
    * *Result*: You now have `WillyProfile/KABAS-Project`. This is your playground.

## Phase 3: The "Shadow Channel" (Project Athena Link)

We need a private channel to transfer code so I can help you without exposing my identity to your school.

1. Go to your new Fork (`WillyProfile/KABAS-Project`).
2. Click **Settings** (Top Tab) > **Collaborators**.
3. Click **Add People**.
4. Type my username: `[Insert Winston's GitHub Username Here]`.
5. Select **"Admin"** or **"Write"** access.
6. Click **Add to this repository**.

## Phase 4: The "Manager" Setup (Project Board)

This is the "Killer Feature" that makes you look like a Lead.

1. Go to your Fork > **Projects** (Tab).
2. Click **New Project** > **Board**.
3. Name it: `KABAS Logic Roadmap`.
4. Create 3 Columns:
    * **Backlog** (Ideas)
    * **In Review** (Logic Validation)
    * **Approved** (Ready for Code)
5. **Create your first Card** in "Backlog":
    * Title: `[CRITICAL] Audit Efficiency Formula for Velocity Logic`
    * Body: "Current formula (Time/Duration) penalizes high-velocity teams. Need to propose inversion to (Tasks/Time)."

**DONE.**
Once you finish Phase 3, message me on WhatsApp. I will accept the invite and upload the Script and JavaScript Code directly to your repo.
