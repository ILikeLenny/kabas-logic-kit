# The Logic Analyst "Battle Card"

**Confidential Script: Meeting 01**

---

## ⚠️ Pre-Meeting Checklist

1. **Clock**: Have a stopwatch or phone timer ready.
2. **Tabs Open**: Have the Team Repo README (with the bad formula) open on your screen.
3. **Mindset**: You are not a student asking for permission. You are the **Quality Assurance Manager**.

## 🎯 Phase 1: The Opening (Establishing Structure)

*Wait for the small talk to die down. Then unmute and say exactly this.*

> **"Okay everyone, let's respect the clock. We have a hard stop at 25 minutes today.**
>
> **As the Logic Analyst, my job is to catch business logic errors before we write bad code. I'll be keeping us on time.**
>
> **[Member 1], please walk us through the User Scenario. (Start Timer)."**

## 🎯 Phase 2: The "Kill Shot" (The Logic Flaw)

*Listen for the word "Efficiency" or "Formula". Or wait until about 10 minutes in.*

> **"Hold on. Stop there.**
>
> **I’ve audited the Efficiency Formula in the README, and we have a critical logic failure.**
>
> **Currently, the formula divides by 'Project Duration'.**
> **Mathematically, this means if we drag the project out for 100 days, we get a BETTER score than if we finish in 5 days.**
>
> **It incentivizes procrastination. We cannot build this.**
>
> **I have already written a JavaScript class that fixes this by calculating 'Velocity' (Tasks per Hour) instead. I will upload the class to the repo tonight. Is everyone agreed on using Velocity?"**

---

## 🎯 Phase 3: The Closing (Assigning Action)

*At the 20-minute mark.*

> **"We have 5 minutes left.**
> **Action Items:**
>
> 1. **[Member 1]**: Mockup the Dashboard.
> 2. **[Member 3]**: Check the API rate limits for 50 teams.
> 3. **Myself**: I will set up the **GitHub Project Board** and upload the **Velocity Metric Code**.
>
> **Meeting adjourned."**
